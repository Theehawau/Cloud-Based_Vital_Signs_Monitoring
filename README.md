# Cloud-Based Vital Signs Monitoring
Vital signs indicate the quality of the essential functions of the human body. Infants generally have minimal to no physical movement, so their life state must be monitored via vital signs. A system that can monitor said vital signs and allow access to measured data remotely would minimize the need for frequent physical monitoring of infants and serve as an interface between Guardians and Medical Personnel. A Wi-Fi module equipped Microcontroller will be interfaced with sensors to measure the vital signs and send measured data to a web server. The Web server will be used for remote data display, data storage, and telegram notifications if measured data is fatal. The developed system measures the vital signs in 5000ms intervals, displays the measured data locally, and sends the measured data to a cloud database. The website updates the data display in 2000ms intervals.
